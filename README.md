Extra material for SG Zurich Python courses (2019)

## Install Python
**Please visit [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)**
- Select Windows or MacOS
- Click download for **Python 3.7 version**
- Save it (.exe or .dmg), it's ~ 600 megs
- Launch the installer (.exe or .dmg)
- Follow the steps (not need to change the defaults) and install.

A `Anaconda` folder should be created, either in the start menur (Windows) or the app launcher (MacOS). In that folder you should see a **Jupyter Notebook** application with the following icon :

It will launch a new window (text based console application), and it will open a link in your web browser, the [Jupyter notebook file browser](http://localhost:8888/tree)
